### Windows 11 was revealed a few months ago, and it's pretty underwhelming.

There is some new stuff, like a refreshed UI, and... well, uhh... let me think........

Right, there's almost nothing new.

It's the same shit as before, just with a frosty white/black start menu and taskbar, and now also now without WAAS (Windows-as-a-Service). Although this means that you won't get interrupted by regular updates, it also means that instead of Windows 10 being the "Last version of Windows," we wil most likely be seeing more major releases like Windows 11 in the future.  
Also, when did Microsoft reveal Windows 11? Oh right, end of June, and Microsoft *STILL* hasn't given standalone prices for the software. Like I give two shits, but others might. 

But, despite all this, I'll give my two cents: ***IT'S FINE.*** It is. It's basically just a UI change, it affects performance almost not at all, except for a bug that I assume will be fixed by Microsoft before RTM next month, where sometimes the framerate of only certain windows slows down to 1hz, making them practically unusable.

Oh right, RTM. For those of you out of the loop, "RTM" stands for Release-To-Manufacturing, or basically the first public non-beta or preview release of any piece of software. When did microsoft say RTM would be in their Windows 11 release video? November, right? Well, Microsoft is as Microsoft does, so they [moved it forward.](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2021/08/31/windows-11-available-on-october-5/) They "couldn't wait to release it," so they decided to push the release date to early October. Now, what does this sound like?

Windows ME.

Windows Vista.

Every piece game, os, or any software that Microsoft, Apple, or any AAA game studio has ever rushed out the door to *compete with competition.*

As I'm sure you know, Microsoft has a pattern: Windows 95 was good. 98 was bad. 98 Second Edition was good. ME was bad. XP was good. Vista was bad. 7 was good, 8 was bad, and 10 is good. See it? It alternates, and I am very confident that this pattern will continue.

I guess we'll see on October 5th...
