### DTV is a tough class.

Fun, but tough nonetheless.

Constant effort is *required* if you want to pass the class.

If you're the right kind of person, it's easy. If you're not, it's hard.

### You are now about to read a first person perspective of what it's like to be in DTV.

The following events occur every Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday.

  7:25 AM: School starts. Nothing related to DTV happens yet.

  10:44 AM: 3rd hour ends, 4th Hour starts.

After lunch, the Newscast Meeting starts. Here, we discuss what will go into the newscast that day, including headlines, extra slugs, sports, weather, and what we talk about at the end bit.
  
After the meeting, we start working. A policy we have is that anchors write their own slugs. If an anchor is a new kid and can't write in 4th or 5th hour, they just anchor.
  
We have specific people doing specific jobs. Producers decide what goes in the newscast. Writers write the newscast. Graphics puts together any fullscreens or nameplates that might be needed. Studio prepares the studio for the newscast.
  
Then, after everything's written and produced, everyone comes down during the period in between 5th and 6th hour. Here, everyone has crucial jobs that need to be done efficiently and correctly.
  
The director is responsible for calling out camera shots and any graphics that need to be pulled up. The tech director is the person actually sitting at the switcher and making sure all the graphics, camera shots, and videos show up in the switcher correctly. Audio manages all of the audio for the newscast, including switcher audio, anchor mics, and the audio from our CD player. The floor director is a person in the studio responsible for cuing anchors, and ensuring an overall smooth newscast. The camera operators..... well, operate the cameras. They need to make sure that their shots look as best as they can all the time. The prompter operator operates the teleprompter that tells the anchors what they need to say. Finally, the anchors need to look presentable on-air (2-piece, tie). They also need to make sure that they can pronounce every word in the script correctly.
  
### But what about events?

DTV also broadcasts major school events, including football games, volleyball games, basketball games, auditorium events, and much more. What happens here?

We come about 3 hours before the start of the event to plan out the event and set up the venue. We take this time to make sure that mics and cameras work.

Once the event starts, we will have up to 4 cameras, plus a director, audio, graphics, and social media. After the event, we pack up, and go home. Football games usually end at 9:30, so we go home at 10. Every game will be different, though. Overtime, injuries, and many other factors can play into game time.

And, of course, stories. They are the foundation of a good newscast.

In DTV, everybody needs to be working on something every day, whether it be writing the newscast, working on a story or PSA, taking care of the graphics for the newscast, among other things.

A story is a long, preproduced video with voiceovers, b-roll, and graphics to accompany. Usually, they are about a big happening either locally, nationally, or worldwide. My last story was one surrounding the recent developments regarding the Line 5 controversy. Usually, you take about a month, to write, shoot, track VO for, and edit together a story, though you can work faster if you're under crunch time.

And that's it, that what we do at DTV on a daily basis. Everybody goes through the motion. As of the day this was posted, I'll have to tech direct tomorrow, which is one of the most stressful jobs. I might do a POV. I don't know.
