### Standardized testing is employed all across the US and the world as a method of measuring the mental capacity and ability of children going to college and beyond.

What this means is that one day can change a kid's life forever. This could be the day they take the SAT, the ACT, an AP test, the ASVAB, the CSAT if you live in South Korea, the GRE in the UK, along with a plethora of other tests in different regions of the world.

This is, in my opinion, stupid.
